# @storystage/stage

Babylon.js scene, model loading, joints, cameras and markers, picking, transforms, offscreen render.

- **Owner:** S3
- **Workplan:** WP5
- **Status:** WP5a built (5.1 to 5.5). The frame rate on the reference devices waits for #6.

## Entries

| Import | What it gives | Loads Babylon.js? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@storystage/stage` | The `Stage` contract, the backdrop list | No |
| `@storystage/stage/babylon` | `createBabylonStage`, for the studio and export | Yes |
| `@storystage/stage/testing` | `FakeStage` and the contract's test suite | No |

## Using it

Code against the `Stage` type. Only what makes the stage needs `@storystage/stage/babylon`, and that's best imported with `import()`, so that a page with no scene doesn't load Babylon.js.

```ts
// Rehearse: draw every frame, and seek to the clock first.
const stage = createBabylonStage({ canvas, models: modelsFromManifest(manifest, folder) });
await stage.load(setup);
stage.schedule(commands);
stage.startLive(() => stage.seek(clock.now()));

// Export: a fixed time step, on a canvas that's never on the page.
const stage = createBabylonStage({ canvas, models, offscreen: true });
await stage.load(setup);
stage.schedule(commands);
for (let f = 0; f < frames; f++) {
  stage.seek(micros(f / fps));
  const frame = await stage.renderFrame(); // RGBA, top row first
}
```

Call `resize()` when the canvas changes size. Clicks and keys on the canvas reach `onEvent` by themselves. Without a `models` source, a scene can use only stand-ins.

## How it fits together

`timeline.ts` works the scene out, with no graphics: the scene at any time is a pure function of the set-up and the commands so far. `FakeStage` and `BabylonStage` both wrap it, so they agree exactly. `BabylonStage` copies the timeline's state onto Babylon.js objects on each `seek`, and nothing else moves them.

## What the contract doesn't spell out

- **Directions.** Right-handed, Y up, everything faces +Z, the camera included. Looking along +Z, +X is on the left of the picture (spec 02, Directions). Babylon.js's own cameras look along -Z in a right-handed scene, so the camera's node carries an extra half turn.
- **Vehicles.** A rider keeps its pose relative to its vehicle. `transform` is still relative to the scene. Scale isn't carried, as in Alice.
- **Targets.** `moveTo`, `turnToFace` and `asSeenBy` may name a marker as well as an object. Markers aren't in `objects()`.
- **Touching.** Alice's rule, in `hull.ts`: each object has a footprint and a height from its box in the scene. Proximity is the same test with a margin, so it measures the gap between two things, not between their centres.
- **Backdrops.** `backdrops.ts` holds Alice's 20 starting templates, with her numbers. Her fog value is cubed to give the density. Ground surfaces are flat colours until WP3's textures arrive.
- **Facing the camera.** A camera with no rotation and a model with no rotation both face +Z, so the camera sees the model's back. To face the camera, a model needs half a turn.
- **Events.** `collisionStart` fires once, when a pair starts to touch, and not for a pair already touching at the start. Rewinding fires nothing. `proximityEnter` isn't fired yet: nothing tells the stage which distances to watch (WP4b's contract pull request).
- **Budgets.** Spike 1.2 is waiting for its device runs, so nothing here is held to a budget yet.

## Tests

`pnpm test` runs the contract suite on `NullEngine`, which can't draw. `packages/stage/e2e` runs the real stage in a browser, for pixels, and `tests/scenes/` holds the reference scenes. Look at the pictures too: a room with a yellow floor once passed every test here.
